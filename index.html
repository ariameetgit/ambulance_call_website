            <h2>🚑 When Every Second Counts</h2>
            <p>Imagine someone dials <strong>999</strong> because a family member has collapsed. The operator on the phone has to make a split-second decision: <strong>Is this a life-threatening emergency?</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes, it's hard to tell. The caller might be panicking, crying, or unable to speak clearly.</p>
            <p><strong>This is where our project comes in.</strong> We are building a smart AI helper that listens to the call alongside the human operator to spot danger signs instantly.</p>

            <h2>🕵️‍♂️ Meet the "Voice Detective"</h2>
            <p>Our AI system is like a super-sensitive detective. It doesn't just "hear" words; it listens for hidden clues in the sound itself.</p>
            <p>It looks for two types of clues:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    <strong>1. The Words (Text):</strong> Did the caller say <em>"Chest pain"</em> or <em>"Not breathing"</em>?
                    <br><span style="color: #666; font-style: italic;">(Think of this like reading subtitles.)</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2. The Sound (Audio):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is the caller gasping for air?</li>
                        <li>Is their voice shaking with extreme panic?</li>
                        <li>Is there a loud crash in the background?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span style="color: #666; font-style: italic;">(Think of this like understanding the "mood" of the sound.)</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🚦 How It Works (The 3 Steps)</h2>
            <p>You don't need to be a computer scientist to understand how it works. It follows three simple steps:</p>
            
            <div style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <h3>Step 1: Listening 👂</h3>
                <p>The AI listens to the live audio from the ambulance call.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <h3>Step 2: Thinking 🧠</h3>
                <p>It converts the voice into text (like Siri does) and analyzes the sound waves. It compares this call to thousands of past emergency calls to see if it matches a "Category 1" (Life-Threatening) pattern.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h3>Step 3: Alerting 🚨</h3>
                <p>If the AI thinks the patient is in critical danger, it flashes a <strong style="color: red;">Red Light</strong> on the operator's screen. This helps the operator send an ambulance immediately.</p>

            <h2>❓ Why Do We Need This?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speed matters:</strong> In a cardiac arrest, every minute without help reduces survival chances by 10%. Our AI tries to save those precious minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Overwhelming Demand:</strong> Every second counts, but there are simply too many calls coming in at the same time. AI acts as a "super-filter" to ensure that life-threatening cases don't get stuck in the queue.</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 20px; border-left: 6px solid #155799; margin-top: 30px; border-radius: 4px;">
                <strong>Important Note:</strong> The AI does NOT replace humans. It is just a helpful tool—like a co-pilot—to make sure no emergency is missed.
